# PIXIE THE ASTRO CAT
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description: Nyan Cat clone with user input for rainbow dash and meowing
#### I used the pygame library, to create a window where the user can play with Pixie, the Astro Cat
#### I implemented three classes, the Cat class, which creates, draws and helps you move this cat
#### the particle1 class, which emits multiple aura like particle objects from the cat that look really cool and add to the space vibe
#### and the particlenyan class, with which I created the rainbow dash effect, whenever you press the space bar
#### the cat also meows if you press the m button
#### the testing was a bit weird because I didn't really know how to test this program other than just run it and see if it works
#### but hopefully it's correct 
#### the video I uploaded demos the project and explains the logic behind it. Hope you guys like it! 
#### the folder contains the pixel art for the cat, a space background, a meow sound, the project, the test_project.py file and this README
